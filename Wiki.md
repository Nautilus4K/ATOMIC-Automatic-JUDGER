Welcome to the wiki of ATOMIC Automatic Judger, here you will get to see how to use things

## Judging

### Wait time
You might have seen a setting called wait_time in settings. It is when the system found multiple files that is waiting to be tested and is going to test them, the system will refer to that 'wait_time' to reload the current queue.

### Time limit
When executing a program, the speed might not always be the fastest, because of that, there's a time_limit setting, which will applies for all execution tasks. When a file crosses that line, it will automatically be terminated, therefore saving time.

### Testing
When the application is being tested, its details are always going to be added into the logs, so customzing the logs is probably one of the highest priority.

#### Show or hide I/O details
To show or hide I/O details, turn show_test in settings on or off. This will make the software show or hide the input/output details.
